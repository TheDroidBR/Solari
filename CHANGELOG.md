## [1.6.1] - 2026-02-27
### 🔧 Hotfix & Improvements

---

### 🐛 Critical Fix
- **Auto-Updater Fix**: Fixed a critical bug in the update batch script where the `echo "%~nx2" | find /I "Setup"` command crashed silently because no arguments were passed, causing the old executable to be deleted but the new version never copied. This affected all previous versions attempting to auto-update.

### ✨ In-App Update Button
- **Download Button**: A new animated button now appears next to the version badge when a newer version is available on GitHub. Clicking it triggers the same splash-screen update flow as the automatic updater.
- **Silent Check**: The app silently checks for updates on startup (after 5s) and every 10 minutes, showing the button only when an update is found.

### 🔌 Real-Time BetterDiscord Detection
- **Live Polling**: BetterDiscord status (installed, broken, uninstalled) is now polled every 5 seconds while the Plugins tab is open, updating the indicator in real time.
- **Smart Polling**: Polling automatically stops when you leave the Plugins tab to save resources.

### 🎯 RPC Connection Status Fix
- **Accurate Header Indicator**: The status indicator in the header now reflects the **actual** RPC connection state instead of just showing "Connected" whenever the toggle is on. It shows "Conectando..." (orange) while attempting to connect and "Conectado" (green) only when truly connected.
- **Unified Status**: The `rpc-status` IPC events now update both the header indicator and the Server Status section simultaneously.

### 📡 Server Status Redesign
- **Moved to Settings Tab**: The "Status do Servidor" section has been relocated from the Rich Presence tab to the bottom of the Settings tab.
- **Modern Grid Layout**: Redesigned with a 2x2 service grid featuring animated status dots, service labels, and connection values for WebSocket, Discord RPC, SpotifySync, and SmartAFK.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-02-20
### 🌐 The Clickable Links & Plugin Overhaul

Solari now supports Clickable Rich Presence URLs and ships a much cleaner interface for managing Plugins!

---

### ✨ Clickable Rich Presence
- **Clickable Details & State**: You can now attach custom hyperlinks directly to your Discord Activity. When users click on your Line 1 (Details) or Line 2 (State) in your Discord profile, they will be redirected to your links!
- **Core Integration**: Clickable links are natively supported by the Solari Auto-Detection engine, applying your preset URLs instantly when you switch games or browse websites.
- **Grid UI Layout**: Side-by-side input groupings keep the URL configurations naturally tied to their text components.

### 🎨 Clean UI & Plugin Managers
- **Focused Dashboard**: Extracted plugin-specific visuals (like SpotifySync and SmartAFK settings) away from the general Rich Presence page, drastically reducing clutter on the main dashboard.
- **Dynamic Plugin Modals**: Added dedicated "Config" buttons to cards inside the Plugins tab. Plugin preferences now open in a beautiful, isolated glassmorphic pop-up directly where you manage them.

### 🔧 System Settings & UI Polish
- **Instant Splash Screen**: The Solari Splash Screen now initializes *synchronously* the moment the application process starts. This eliminates the previous ~1.5s delay caused by the system reading initial data configuration files, making the app feel instantly responsive.
- **Dedicated Settings Tab**: The main configuration menu has been extracted from the top navigation bar into its own specialized "Configurações" (Settings) tab.
- **Eco Mode Toggle**: Added a new visual setting (General > Mostrar Modo Eco) to hide the Eco Mode switch from the top bar entirely, keeping the interface pristine for users who don't need it.
- **Smart "Start Minimized"**: The "Start Minimized" toggle is now dynamically linked to "Start with Windows". It will gray itself out and disable if auto-start is turned off.
- **Intuitive Modals**: Simple prompts (like the Client ID configuration window) can now be instantly canceled by simply clicking anywhere outside the prompt box on the dark background.

### 🐛 Tracker & Backend Fixes
- **Installer Forward-Compatibility**: Rewrote the core `updater.js` self-extraction batch script to dynamically test if an incoming update payload contains the phrase `Setup` (e.g., `Solari_Setup.exe`). If detected, the 1.6.0 updater will automatically suppress the standard portable copy-paste behavior and execute a silent NSIS installation (`/S`) instead. This paves the way for a seamless user migration from Portable to an Installer format in version 1.7.0.
- **Discord Preview Startup**: Fixed a bug where the Rich Presence preview image wouldn't render immediately on application start unless an Imgur URL was being resolved, requiring a manual preset change to load visually.
- **Global Identity Sync**: Eliminated a race condition that caused the Discord Preview header (e.g., "Jogando XYZ") to appear blank on startup because the Global Client ID was fetched before the App Profiles had fully loaded from memory.
- **InfinityFree API Bypass**: Engineered a brute-force JSON scraper inside `apiFetch()` for `admin.html`. This extracts raw API outputs and completely bypasses Cloudflare/InfinityFree's tracking scripts (`<script type="...-text/javascript">`), which were corrupting the JSON parsing engine and silently breaking the Admin panel.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-18
### 🚀 The Plugin & Splash Update

Solari now features a **Real-Time Plugin Manager**, a sleek **Splash Screen**, and speaks a new language!

---

### 🔌 The Ultimate Plugins Experience
The new **Plugins Tab** is your command center for extending Solari.
- **⚡ Background Auto-Checks**: Solari quietly checks for plugin updates every 5 minutes in the background. If an update is found, the button changes to "Update" automatically.
- **📦 Smart Versioning**: We now use semantic versioning (comparing `v1.0.0` vs `v1.1.0`) to ensure you only get notified for *real* updates, ignoring simple formatting changes.
- **🛠️ BetterDiscord Integration**: Automatically checks if BetterDiscord is installed and working correctly. If an update breaks it, Solari lets you know immediately.
- **One-Click Management**: Install, Update, or Reinstall plugins with a single click.

### 🌍 Global Languages
- **🇩🇪 German Support**: Willkommen! Solari is now fully translated into German (Deutsch).
- **🇪🇸 Spanish Polish**: Added missing translations for Spanish users.
- **🇧🇷 Portuguese & 🇺🇸 English**: Fully supported as always.

### ✨ Splash & Core Features
- **Splash Screen**: A brand-new startup splash screen with the Solari logo, animated status indicators, download progress bar, and version display. Inspired by Discord's boot flow.
- **Update System Overhaul**: Completely rewritten auto-update system. App and plugin updates are now checked during the splash phase instead of after the main window loads.
  - Splash shows real-time download progress (percentage, MB downloaded/total).
  - Respects `Auto Check App Updates` and `Auto Check Plugin Updates` settings.
  - Offline/error scenarios display a brief error message and proceed to the main window.
- **Changelog Modal**: When launching a new version for the first time, a glassmorphic modal displays the release notes fetched from GitHub. Shown only once per version.
- **Plugin Update Toasts**: When plugins are updated during startup, a slide-in toast notification appears in the main window showing the plugin name and version change (e.g., `🔌 SpotifySync updated: 2.0.1 → 2.0.2`).
- **Toast Notification System**: Reusable `showSolariToast()` function with 4 types (success, info, warning, error), slide-in/out animations, and stacking support.

---

### 🛠️ Improvements

- **Version-Based Plugin Updates**: Plugin updates now compare `@version` metadata from the BetterDiscord header instead of raw file content. Eliminates false-positive updates caused by Windows line-ending differences (CRLF vs LF).
- **Hidden Start Support**: When starting with `--hidden` flag (auto-start minimized to tray), the splash screen is completely skipped.
- **Boot Flow**: Main window now starts hidden and is shown only after fully loading, preventing the blank white window flash.

---

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Fixed**: Changelog modal appearing on every launch instead of only once per version. Root cause: `saveData()` was overwriting `lastSeenVersion` because it wasn't included in the save object.
- **Fixed**: Plugins being re-downloaded on every startup even when already up-to-date. Root cause: raw content comparison failed due to `\r\n` (Windows) vs `\n` (download) line endings.
- **Fixed**: Wrong plugin filename in update checker (`SmartAFK.plugin.js` → `SmartAFKDetector.plugin.js`).
- **Fixed**: `updatedPlugins` variable scoping error causing crash on startup (`ReferenceError: updatedPlugins is not defined`).
- **Fixed**: UI showing "Reconectando..." (Reconnecting) infinitely when Solari starts and no preset is applied. Root cause: RPC status events could be lost during page load due to a race condition. Added a status re-sync after window loads and improved initial status text to "Conectando..." instead of "Reconectando...".

---

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Config Persistence**: Fixed all settings (Quick Setup Wizard, SoundBoard, presets, etc.) being lost when switching to a different .exe or version. Data is now stored in a stable `%APPDATA%\Solari` location instead of being tied to the executable path. 🔧
- **"Iniciando..." Stuck**: Fixed the status text getting stuck on "Starting..." due to translation system conflicts.
- **Timestamp Preservation**: Fixed Rich Presence elapsed time resetting every time a browser extension status changed (viewer count, episode, category, channel). The timestamp now only resets when the **platform actually changes** (e.g., Twitch → YouTube), preserving continuity within the same platform.
- **RPC Reconnection**: Fixed Rich Presence not reconnecting after Discord restarts.
- **Zombie Plugins**: Fixed SmartAFK and SpotifySync attempting to reconnect after being disabled.
- **Auto-Detect Notifications**: Fixed duplicate 'Auto-Detection' notifications when the preset hasn't changed.

- **About Modal**: Now displays the correct version automatically and supports all languages dynamically.
- **Toast Notifications**: Fixed "undefined" titles in toast notifications and translated all system messages.
- **Priority Race Condition**: Fixed a rare bug where multiple sources (e.g., Browser Extension + Auto-Detect) could mix Client IDs and activity data.
- **Soundboard Persistence**: Fixed settings (volume, mic toggle) resetting to default on restart due to race condition.
- **SoundBoard Drag-and-Drop**: Fixed audio file drop zone not accepting files. Both the mini drop zone and the entire SoundBoard tab now support drag-and-drop with multiple files at once. 📁
- **SoundBoard Multi-File Picker**: The "Add Sound" button now allows selecting multiple files at once instead of one at a time.
- **Microphone Optimization**: Fixed Solari holding the microphone stream active even when "Mic + Sounds" was disabled.
- **Extension Reapply Bug**: Fixed Rich Presence not reapplying when closing and reopening the same platform (e.g., Twitch → close → reopen Twitch).
- **Infinite RPC Retry**: Solari now aggressively retries Discord connection (every 3s instead of 10s) and never gives up, ensuring it connects even if other apps (Medal) act up. 🔌
- **Preview App Name**: Fixed global Client ID showing "Discord App" in the Rich Presence preview when RPC is disconnected. The real app name is now fetched on startup. 🏷️
- **Dev Mode Auto-Launch**: Fixed `npm run dev` accidentally registering as the Windows auto-start entry. Auto-launch now only registers in packaged builds.
- **Tab Fallback**: Smarter clearing logic prevents status flickering when closing duplicate tabs.

---

## [1.3.2] - 2026-01-26

### 🛡️ Critical Stability
- **Fixed**: Solari auto-detect would sometimes get stuck in a "loop", causing Rich Presence to flicker on and off. Added a robust "3-cycle debounce" to prevent this.
- **Fixed**: Conflict between "Game Detection" and "Website Detection" where one would constantly clear the other. Now they are synchronized.
- **Fixed**: App crash on startup if the Tray Icon image failed to load (Empty image fix).

### ⚡ Extension & Detection Improvements
- **Smart Extension Resolution**: The browser extension now automatically uses your specific "App Profiles" (Client IDs) if it detects a matching keyword (e.g., "Twitch" or "Netflix"), instead of always using the generic "A Game" ID.
- **Priority Logic Enforced**: Running games/apps now strictly override website detection. If you open a game while watching YouTube, the Game status will take priority.

### ✨ New Features & UX
- **OS Language Detection**: Solari now automatically identifies your operating system's language on startup and adapts the interface accordingly (currently supports English and Portuguese).
- **Edit App Profiles**: You can finally edit existing App Profiles! Added a pencil button (✏️) to modify Name and Client ID.
- **Improved UI**: Password fields (Client IDs) now have better alignment and styling, matching the rest of the interface.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-01-25

### ✨ New Features
- **Changelog Page**: Added new "Changelog" option in Help menu and Website Navbar that links to a dynamic release notes page.
- **Privacy Center**: New "Help > About" menu with direct access to Privacy Policy and social links.
- **Privacy Policy**: Added comprehensive Privacy Policy to website and app.
- **User Statistics**: Admin dashboard now shows how many users are online and their version distribution (anonymous data).

### 🚀 Performance & Optimizations
- **Instant Startup**: Implemented "Lazy Loading" for the Sound System. The app now opens instantly and loads the heavy audio engine in the background.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimized the internal tracker to reuse browser instances, significantly reducing RAM/CPU usage when idling.

### 🛡️ Data Safety
- **Auto-Backup**: Solari now creates a `customrp-data.json.bak` backup file every time you save your settings.
- **Rescue System**: If your save file gets corrupted, Solari automatically enters "Rescue Mode" to protect your remaining data and creates a rescue file.
- **Profile Recovery**: Implemented a smart recovery system that restored "App Profiles" lost in previous updates by analyzing saved Presets.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Fixed**: Header alignment issues in the main UI.
- **Fixed**: Auto-detect presets not showing buttons in Rich Presence.
- **Fixed**: Browser extension presets not showing buttons.
